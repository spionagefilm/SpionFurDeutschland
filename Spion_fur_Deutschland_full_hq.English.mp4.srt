1
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,450
I have your briefcase of 20!

2
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,580
Air raid alarm came home so easily.

3
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,840
He started, however.

4
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,410
Do you know what that means?

5
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,630
Man, or what were you?

6
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,630
To phone? Do you have anything for the post office?

7
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,130
Herr Schultz?  Thank you.

8
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,930
What is that, thank you, an American?  Yes. I got them in Spain.

9
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,840
<i>Department please. </i> Did you come from Spain?

10
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:34,240
He is on the list, whether to be picked up from Mansfeld to Rome and probably in the Vatican again?

11
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,630
Thank goodness that you are here. Come in right now, you are urgently needed.  Gimpel is here.

12
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,110
From now on hold all meetings.

13
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:00,410
Hello! I stayed in the sunny south, I stayed there a bit longer.  Why do I think you want something from me? What's happening? 

14
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,890
You should win the war. <i>I am late. What is it?</i> The most secret commando thing of the war.

15
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,930
But here in the office everyone knows. I, in your place, stayed in Spain. know in your place, who remained in Spain. Makes me curious.

16
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,190
See you later?

17
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,070
Yes, we'll have a Cognac later.

18
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:30,170
Hello Inge!  Erich! Please don't. What do I do? Who were you hoping for?

19
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,670
Are not you glad that I came?

20
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,280
But I brought you something. Parisian perfume.

21
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,130
That's it. In Madrid we meet tonight.

22
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,720
If you're still here afterwards. Mr. Gimpel is here.

23
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,940
I did not know that- I'll come you later.  No, they're all here because of you. What, for my sake? Yes. Please get us a Cognac, Shäfer. Yes sir.

24
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,600
Are you tired? A little bit already.

25
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,700
But now I'm really curious.

26
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,190
Can you be too?

27
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,140
You know Gimpel that we have another job for you. Thank you.

28
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,950
They have imagination, are intelligent and have great courage.

29
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,660
As if you wanted to give me a medal.

30
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,250
Medal?

31
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,540
No.

32
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,040
This means that we will give you the order.

33
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,820
Is something like a medal. Do you know what that is?

34
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,540
That was natural.

35
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,210
I do not know how far I can expect physical knowledge.

36
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,150
Let's wait for it. What is the German about?

37
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,740
Professor Hahn managed to split uranium before the war and thus to release atomic nuclei.

38
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,920
Hahn's research came to America.

39
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,720
The Americans immediately recognized that if Germany continued to do so, it would very soon be able to use nuclear energy for military purposes.

40
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,180
For a bomb, you understand, an atomic bomb.

41
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,260
And so America immediately began to undertake the production of such a bomb.

42
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,790
And that's just it.

43
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,030
We do not know it. We know a lot.

44
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,090
This is called the Manhattan Project.

45
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,290
We can say names here, addresses of people they can use to approach the project.

46
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,730
What do you mean? Approaching passing.

47
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,120
United States?

48
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,860
Yes, you are our best man.

49
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,510
We have no other choice.

50
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,660
Listen, we have no choice.

51
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,540
Let's tell you what it means to have the atomic bomb.

52
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,000
Whoever has them first wins them.

53
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:53,800
No matter where we stand, whether at the urn or in the Caucasus, it does not matter what happens when you throw an atomic bomb.

54
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,790
It's hard to believe but an atomic bomb has the power of millions of tons of dynamite.

55
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:10,970
What is happening? Total annihilation within a radius of several kilometers by a flash of light, in the core 6000 degrees Celsius prevail.

56
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,540
Then comes a blast of pressure, which causes every house to collapse and ruptures unhinged people's skin.

57
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,860
If she has not been burned before.

58
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,960
And not to forget the radioactivity itself!

59
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,940
That's enough. That's why we brought her here.

60
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,700
We need to know how far the Americans are, not just how far they are, but everything they can find out.

61
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,140
Every little thing is important.

62
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,080
We need technical details, drawing and construction plans, where we built the bomb like the works to each other.

63
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,970
Where are the sensitive, the vulnerable points?

64
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
How can you paralyze the production?

65
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,710
And all as an assignment to a single man, a single man?

66
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,840
How do you communicate with the whole order?

67
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,990
You're the first person we're referring to, as a scout here or from South America, so to speak.

68
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,100
There is a whole organization waiting there, just for you and with whom you are in constant contact.

69
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,730
What is the cause? There's a message in American newspapers Which newspaper?

70
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,590
La Prensa? They get you, all over America, the messages worked out.

71
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:29,270
This is all very well and nice, but that the whole plan as such at all a chance, the chance they have, may not be great.

72
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,950
But we also have to take the smallest chance.

73
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,440
Probably we have to succeed, but maybe it will not be enough for me.

74
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,050
Excuse me but conquers the electric chair.

75
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:40,490
I prefer to take pictures. That's why it's an assignment that you want to volunteer.

76
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,850
How should I get over?

77
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,970
There is a possibility with a specially equipped woman.

78
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,220
You would have to parachute back to America back and forth.

79
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,380
So much fuel does not have you back.

80
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,750
Could not it be an insane company with a freighter?

81
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,230
That's not a problem. You have to arrive from South America.

82
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,320
At the corner you know me.

83
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,910
I find the most promising the crossing with a U-Boat.

84
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,530
Two men get that.

85
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,060
You want a whole fleet, you can have.

86
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,110
The American coast is the best guarded in the world.

87
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,490
At New York, there are only two or three bays that are suitable.

88
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,200
The Americans know that.

89
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,300
I thought of the French.

90
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,810
Sommerfeldt.

91
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,640
And fear does not do that.

92
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,800
I'll wonder I'll be fine.

93
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,160
Let's say the landing works, although the chance is one in a hundred.

94
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,580
What do I do then? There are far too many ways to attract attention.

95
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,410
Let us not fool ourselves, gentlemen.

96
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,330
A European smells one.

97
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,660
These are not reasons. We get everything we need.

98
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,150
I want to tell you what I need.

99
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,370
A man who goes along.

100
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,950
There have to be Americans.

101
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,150
A genuine. I have never been to New York.

102
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:24,350
I need someone who can tell me how to get from the train station, how to get my hair cut, how far you wear your pants, how to take a cigarette out with your fingers, need an average guy somewhere, tell me all about it and on which I can rely.

103
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,040
Can you have it? I will then notify abroad.

104
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,330
That's not a good idea. There we certainly find no problem.

105
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,890
Act as if you only had how important.

106
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,540
You get what you need dollars.

107
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,490
50,000 hundreds of thousands, gold or diamonds?

108
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,080
Say yes.

109
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,280
Advances.

110
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,470
I have the feeling that when I jasper, I put the rope around my neck myself.

111
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,540
Nobody wants to lie to us.

112
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,630
But it's the job that's ever been forgiven.

113
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:00,710
Gimpel.

114
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,030
Go to America!

115
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,980
They are arrested. I can die.

116
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,200
Such an assignment would only be awarded to the world once.

117
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,850
Do not you understand that this irritates a man, just has to irritate him?

118
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,180
Besides, you want to throw that atomic bombs are bad enough.

119
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,930
Eight men were then transferred to America, also with U-Boats.

120
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,780
That's when we knew they were coming.

121
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,420
They landed on the electric chair.

122
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,820
But you did not see the files.

123
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,120
Did we collect everything? Seeing files and photos of what a human being looks like, who is chasing electrical current through his body.

124
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,980
A pretty picture.

125
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,760
I've been watching the defense for four years now.

126
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:34,950
Do not you think about it yet? Dirty business is the dirty business.

127
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:59,340
Since you would be at 20 meters, the bay is secured, probably by a destroyer, of course, by radar and home appliances.

128
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,330
That is, 90 percent of the risk of premature discovery exists.

129
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,640
Of course you have to be lucky.

130
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,880
I mean, why should not you be lucky?

131
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,320
Your honest opinion?

132
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,260
Asked for his honest opinion.

133
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:34,410
I want to know you. The whole thing is a suicide mission, as it is written in the book.

134
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,380
The Americans have really found one.

135
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,050
Exactly the right thing. I have to look at it.

136
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,490
Real Americans become German father and he hates America.

137
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,180
Why do you hate America?

138
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,170
Why does the story tell about your father?

139
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,880
He was interned. I finished it.

140
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,550
I mean, he died there, and since then hates America.

141
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
He is great, the very man we were looking for.

142
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,540
He was born in Boston, older than him.

143
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,430
Can not be, and why he tells here has deserted, defected.

144
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,590
He just has too much anger on America.

145
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,900
We can do whatever they want.

146
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,570
Against the.

147
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,590
Do you like it well?

148
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,240
He does not wear too much, do not worry.

149
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,770
Incidentally, the suitcases came as they wanted.

150
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,020
He looks like an American suitcase, did we say everything?

151
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,550
What are they real?

152
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,520
From department store in Boston has a double bottom, there comes in the radio.

153
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,090
The new one is the most modern shortwave transmitter we have.

154
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:04,790
Good.

155
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:48,180
What are not you doing?

156
00:15:51,550 --> 00:16:02,150
I do not know why, I can not say it, but at some point you stand there and do not know what you're doing in.

157
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:14,070
I am very glad that I like to do something as you are.

158
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,980
What you do, you only do out of vanity.

159
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:24,040
I do not know what you are going to do about the United States now.

160
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,040
You say you love me.

161
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,820
You're kidding yourself. You can not live.

162
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,210
Then nothing. You do not know for love.

163
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:38,190
Maybe you can say that's just too easy.

164
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,550
The place where we will end up, when all goes well.

165
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,610
Career changers.

166
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,110
Cheered.

167
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,820
Ending the day with the fresh air.

168
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,070
For how much longer?

169
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,650
You will not believe it, but I'm looking forward to it.

170
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:51,130
I can be eaten any moment, can the captain?

171
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:04,580
Is there a reasonable suspicion that companies betray themselves in their free choice at their own discretion?

172
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,900
What does that mean?

173
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,110
Two days was traveling 46 days.

174
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,470
It must be there because of the suspicion.

175
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,570
Discretion.

176
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,950
I am driven for it. It remains to learn.

177
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:18,930
Yes, pretty close to running water depths the traffic on the road very strong.

178
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:30,970
20. A destroyer is running.

179
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,270
He comes right to us.

180
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,460
Now and then taxes.

181
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,150
Targeted.

182
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,420
On Seehofer everything is fine, he runs off.

183
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,870
I understand very well, do you understand?

184
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:18,860
Gets away.

185
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,230
And then I followed the trail.

186
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,190
What do you mean, what kind of people came from the water?

187
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,410
Of course I have read before.

188
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,830
I saw her, too. Two men with heavy weapons and radios.

189
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,640
Yes, probably a fantasy.

190
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,260
What I say Our guys over there are on the Rhine, and we have other concerns than sending spies.

191
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,020
Take a taxi and ten minutes?

192
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,330
That's exactly the way to the court martial.

193
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,060
They would not hang.

194
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,280
Why should not I say, because I know what's going on.

195
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,360
If it calms you, we would hang side by side.

196
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,630
Just the feeling that I could call home.

197
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,720
Maybe my mother is on the phone.

198
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,330
I do not need to say anything.

199
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,870
That will not do. But I know it can not be.

200
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,340
From a dead son his mother has nothing.

201
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,490
Dallas.

202
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:45,840
What is going on, what is going on now Dollars with banderole of the German Reichsbank these damned idiots?

203
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,100
It's my own fault. I should have taken care.

204
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,890
Stay away. That's at least 50,000 50,000.

205
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,370
What's this?

206
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,210
The real?

207
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,030
I do not have a dollar leather bag.

208
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,010
000 dollars Reicherts.

209
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:21,430
You have to get together! Not a word too much, think of the gallows, you are standing down.

210
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,100
Exactly 300,000.

211
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,220
I feel like you still have not got what's going on and how dangerous everything is.

212
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:38,530
We belong Together. Everyone alone is lost, never had so much money in life at one go.

213
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,600
None of us can let the others down.

214
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,030
Why, I know. I do not want to hang.

215
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,530
Now with 1000 dollars in the bag.

216
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,770
Let's sleep now, and tomorrow morning we'll be in New York.

217
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:20,870
The.

218
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,440
What do you do?

219
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:42,080
In the evening in a lonely place on the coast Two men see carrying heavy suitcases.

220
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:53,900
I would look very carefully, if you see far and wide nothing.

221
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,280
Nothing went to the police We laughed at him.

222
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,240
That's how German agents have gone ashore.

223
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,180
The war is over for a couple of damn weeks off.

224
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,170
There are still such insane people in our crazy business.

225
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:27,890
When I think about it, we have two cunning and dangerous agents in the States, maybe even in the middle.

226
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,960
I hope you'll take the saying that there's something going on.

227
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,890
I do not remember when he has set up the apparatus.

228
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,090
I feel so funny. It does not work so fast.

229
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,340
What are you saying? I feel like being in a mousetrap.

230
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,170
Do we always have to stay in this room?

231
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:16,470
Yes, it is better. I do not know if I should do something different.

232
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,140
And I want to tell you what you mean.

233
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,680
We should take the money and cheer.

234
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,490
But I say so too.

235
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,490
You, you say.

236
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:20,800
In the cinema there. Reading with this newspaper.

237
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,980
We have two connections with our people here, the advertisements in the newspaper.

238
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,250
Is an address that I am visiting now.

239
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:09,290
It starts, the apparatus stays in the room until I come back.

240
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,830
Can someone hear us here? No.

241
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,740
I do not know who they are.

242
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,220
I did not steal my time.

243
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:30,990
Why is?

244
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,200
At 58 000 634 dollars and 40 cents.

245
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,000
In the years 38 to 42 have received from the German secret service?

246
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,840
That is not true.

247
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,930
I do not know what you're talking about, you have to be crazy.

248
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,530
Can you see it? Where are you from?

249
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,990
I come from berlin. Berlin.

250
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,320
That's a joke! Listen, I have as little time as you.

251
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,630
I have been given a lot of documentation in case your memory should fail them.

252
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,590
They got a lot of dollars for a lot of information that was not bad.

253
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,900
I want to expressly confirm you, if that is your fault, and.

254
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,760
What do you want from me? You have to help me.

255
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,940
Out of business.

256
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,310
You now have a good going on the money of the German defense.

257
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,890
Do you have the business too?

258
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,460
The family does not mind ruining me, making me unhappy?

259
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,230
No, and please stay away from the desk.

260
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,620
If you think of calling the FBI to let me go, remember that you would go up with it.

261
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,600
What do you want from me?

262
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,880
I would like to make you an offer.

263
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:58,330
I learn from you how I approach the project, the atomic bomb.

264
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,940
You know? Of course I know.

265
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,100
Is that not allowed again?

266
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,310
That helps you something else?

267
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,220
That's not my thing. An agent no longer fulfills orders.

268
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,580
I'll get some addresses from you that will help me when I get them.

269
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,930
Then they will never see me again.

270
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,170
But may I give you some advice?

271
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,100
If I were you, I'd run away to South America as fast as I can.

272
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,280
Best I do not like the climate.

273
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,540
The climate is worse.

274
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,750
In three days I will be the address.

275
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,900
I'll be back soon.

276
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:19,140
I can not say he will eventually and then you stand there and do not know what to do.

277
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,660
She is on the phone because someone is there.

278
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,160
You're an idiot!

279
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:56,180
If my life is dear to me and it is mine, you are killing us, if I am today, then tomorrow, then it is better if I suddenly.

280
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,620
What kind of idiot are you?

281
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:27,850
Do I sleep?

282
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,830
I do not have it yet.

283
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,880
What can you drink here? Listen to.

284
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,840
You will understand. I have no desire to be seen with them.

285
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,430
In it you will find an address with which you meet, exactly what you produce.

286
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:11,390
How can I reach him? And now do not tell me goodbye!

287
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,120
I have everything.

288
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:34,580
Pull the bill, pay for the suitcase.

289
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:24,720
You have to give me a little chance.

290
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,390
He has to leave the suitcases somewhere.

291
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,070
A small chance. A very small one.

292
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,700
I have my money two suitcases.

293
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:14,230
I have not lost, you would have my bags there, they stand.

294
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:27,180
Here are always a lot of trouble, I'm not all that annoying.

295
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,090
Exactly what?

296
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,800
What is inside?

297
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:37,760
A pajamas, striped black and yellow, then a camera, a Leica.

298
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,120
Two ties, one gray, one black blue striped.

299
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,430
This is an electronic radio operator.

300
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,990
Do you meet old acquaintances again?

301
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,280
Not for six years. At that time we had together, we are now relatives.

302
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,620
Do you still remember his daughter?

303
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,570
Did they deport you then?

304
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,650
Did they first intern me and then let them go?

305
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,820
Yes, I have here.

306
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,410
I want to leave again.

307
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,510
But we have to see each other What do you live?

308
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,930
I can help you there. Besides, we do not know that again through the rags.

309
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,650
Here are the keys when one is called.

310
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,000
I am still not married.

311
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,910
I do not get along.

312
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,710
I have to be honest, I'm looking forward to it.

313
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,860
Goodbye! Goodbye!

314
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:58,000
I do not understand either.

315
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,440
That can only, what was in it.

316
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,340
Or maybe you found?

317
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,120
I gave up myself.

318
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:27,070
I think it's alright that a friend of mine.

319
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,360
What are you doing here? I wanted to ask you the same.

320
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,110
I am a friend of Paulo Santé, left me his apartment.

321
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,170
He has to have several keys and a lot of people to whom he confides.

322
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,270
Apparently, they've known him pretty well for a long time.

323
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,590
We were together in Peru before the war, at the same company.

324
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,210
Today I met him again.

325
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,070
I have a small fashion store, it is being refurbished.

326
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:49,460
I always said he gave me the keys.

327
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,190
Of course I leave you the apartment.

328
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,770
I can sleep in the business as well.

329
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,290
I have me too.

330
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,480
They are not Americans.

331
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,060
Not? Do you notice that?

332
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,910
Yes, I came here via England, for the first time in New York.

333
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:29,640
Right, I am a deserter from Koln.

334
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,310
We have a whole resume here a gap.

335
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,320
What did you do last year?

336
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,550
I went to Argentina.

337
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,850
Everything came.

338
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:56,740
My father was here only because he was not operated on time.

339
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,970
Are you saying that you did not want to fight for a country that your father imprisons?

340
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,580
That's why I went to Argentina.

341
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,460
Argentina made.

342
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:17,240
Addresses.

343
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,500
Tell us, what did you do in New York?

344
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,280
I had just arrived and wanted.

345
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,290
I gave that up.

346
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,050
On road.

347
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:23,920
Two men, two suitcases.

348
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,410
I hope they realize that desertion costs them a lot.

349
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,210
Two men and two suitcases.

350
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:54,750
I ask you Say, how did you come to the States?

351
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,630
Why do you answer? I do not know.

352
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,790
You do not know that? But I know you have to think about why.

353
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,600
At what time of the day, with which train did you just come by train?

354
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,890
With which, you say?

355
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,680
Answer, where did you go ashore?

356
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:27,260
That's what I asked, when, where do you answer Can not you come with a German U-Boat?

357
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,700
I do not know, what do you want?

358
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,580
I want to tell you what it was like.

359
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,360
It was almost midnight, a bit foggy on the road, on the coast, traffic, lights.

360
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,880
They came ashore on a dinghy.

361
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,650
Gerudert were German marines.

362
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,050
There was someone with them.

363
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,170
They had two suitcases.

364
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,990
They went out into the woods through the woods, stopped a car!

365
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:07,780
Why do not you say?

366
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,090
We have people in Argentina.

367
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,600
I just need a radio message Knowing everything they did.

368
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,400
I flick through every step they have made.

369
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,800
If I know tomorrow morning.

370
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:58,720
My wife and I are not coming home today, tastes like never before in my life, I do not cook that well again.

371
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:04,080
Not the food, to be alone with two.

372
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,270
Help me!

373
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:19,140
Somehow it is strange We only met today and eat together and dream to fall away.

374
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:19,860
Old couple.

375
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,360
I like it very much.

376
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:28,140
Unfortunately not always, but it is so rare.

377
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,780
Are you saying that I do not have a boyfriend?

378
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,300
It's safe. Yes and no.

379
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,660
He is straightforward.

380
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,630
I like people who were as easy as he was.

381
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:46,260
I only love them when they want.

382
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:46,950
I prefer to stay here.

383
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,110
Why are you smiling because that's so unlikely?

384
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:08,800
Being here for the first time in a long time is a gift that I do not know if I can accept.

385
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,060
You can always have such gifts.

386
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,720
It's a crazy world.

387
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,600
That's what makes the war confuse me.

388
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,340
I take off the water.

389
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,960
I'll take the bedroom, they'll take this one, that's fine!

390
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,470
We do not need fear for each other.

391
00:59:50,590 --> 01:00:04,950
Erich Gimpel, can you describe what properties it has?

392
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,370
You have to know. Do you have your memory?

393
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,440
We did not let you say everything you know.- Untranslated subtitle -

394
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:26,950
Leaving a name of a special kind to go somewhere to move.

395
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:40,400
American, what a special you were before.

396
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,840
But now you are an agent who has made an attack on the United States.

397
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,510
We have no reason to understand it.

398
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:52,680
They will have squeezed them out like a lemon.

399
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,840
What do you know about that?

400
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,950
Have a land gone without a purpose?

401
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:02,950
I swear, I do not know.

402
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,260
I'm still talking to you.

403
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:15,820
But at some point he visited someone, he did not tell me.

404
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:27,050
Once he said there should be more, even more people, maybe the South American newspaper.

405
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,890
I think we are on the trail of a big deal.

406
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,550
I still know something.

407
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:43,900
He always picks up the money up here.

408
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:06,960
Excelsior. I got her name from.

409
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,010
When and where can we see each other?

410
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:19,710
How do I recognize it?

411
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,850
I have understood. A dog.

412
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:41,370
I help you with me were 2.

413
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,280
I hope that will.

414
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,490
That's about as accurate as a photograph.

415
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:46,890
All the powers that we need authority, as we have never owned it, is arranged like surveillance.

416
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:57,000
Just as important are the time circumstances, thousands of people would have to use it to pay for them.

417
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,640
When a man comes and asks for a South American newspaper, he pays cash.

418
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:06,630
And what about the press?

419
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:11,520
Not a word of that the public ever put on a man.

420
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,750
He has to be found.

421
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,330
14 million people.

422
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,070
And what about dogs?

423
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,300
I am still very young.

424
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,750
Do we want to talk here? Why not?

425
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,990
Do not run away! Sad!

426
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:37,190
You know what it's about. They want to know what they understand.

427
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,250
I am interested in details that I can get.

428
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,900
Technically, militarily, politically.

429
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,170
And what is this worth to you?

430
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,480
The interests are different.

431
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,250
Some want to win wars.

432
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,550
If you ask me I want to buy a farm.

433
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:58,070
I find that fun. 00:00 At first, you can be sure of being talked to.

434
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,310
More. If I find out anything, nothing to say against.

435
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:06,880
And why did you say?

436
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,750
You do not need to retell.

437
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,940
It is too little for that.

438
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,630
There you have to go on a leash.

439
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,390
He gets it done and the United States leg.

440
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,260
Are you talking to a scientist now?

441
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:44,280
I can not tell you the name, but great class, I'll let you know.

442
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:49,890
And do not forget that I still need a lot of money.

443
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,650
That's Washington again.

444
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,310
I know what you want.

445
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:17,130
Who duplicates this immediately?

446
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:26,880
Any cop in New York apparently can not believe it, then we can wrap up.

447
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:33,240
They pretend that not a man has landed, but a whole army.

448
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:41,790
Somewhere, somewhere in this damned sea of houses.

449
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,720
Since I have the business, I feel happy, understanding.

450
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,290
Somehow I'm proud that I made it.

451
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,920
Later I still have the incidental business.

452
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:09,180
I've already talked to the people here on the first floor.

453
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,360
Of course that will be a kind of music of the future for a long time to come.

454
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,620
But I have already finished the plans.

455
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,170
Do you think that's so far ahead of you?

456
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:23,710
No not at all.

457
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,610
Sure, you know what you want.

458
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:28,080
A future? It's not questionable.

459
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,400
All we have to do is buy something.

460
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,510
We are eating at home again.

461
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,650
You do not believe how fun I am.

462
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,530
I mean cooking and caring for someone.

463
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:50,010
Looks like I want to catch a guy.

464
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,790
So far, there was not one that I would have liked.

465
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:57,500
I was more intentional for myself.

466
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,650
What can I say?

467
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:09,960
Anything?

468
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,400
I have to do something good now.

469
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,330
I once had a girlfriend.

470
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,960
I have a lot of friends then.

471
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,180
What about the girlfriend?

472
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,840
She once told me you do not love anyone.

473
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:33,750
But maybe you'll learn it someday, sometime, probably when you need it.

474
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:36,750
Now it is time.

475
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,560
Tell me, why if you?

476
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:49,990
Well, I've already noticed.

477
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,390
There is something with you.

478
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,040
You are restless, you are smoking all the time.

479
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,580
You are so nervous. Why restless?

480
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,400
I do not have anything. Not really.

481
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:12,680
You have no position. Not completely honest right now.

482
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:17,450
Do you need money? Yes, I understand myself correctly.

483
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,910
I would like to help you.

484
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,130
I really do not need money.

485
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,320
Erik is never so important.

486
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,960
Do you think I will think about it?

487
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,270
Where did I meet this professor?

488
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:48,430
He sits on a bench and reads his newspaper.

489
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,790
Next to him is a black leather briefcase.

490
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,600
They ask if there is still a place left.

491
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:55,680
And he says please. He then puts the briefcase from one side to the other.

492
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:56,240
Good.

493
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:10,420
Another question. I would like to have an overview of a map Do you understand how the works relate to each other and what is produced in them?

494
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,010
I understand when I get that.

495
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,530
Are you a step closer to your farm?

496
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,340
I would like to hear more about that.

497
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,230
I only get a newspaper.

498
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,260
They seem to understand something.

499
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:35,690
I have a home myself, broken all carpets.

500
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,000
You should! You can see my wife, my wife.

501
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,440
Do not we mind?

502
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:21,020
I suppose you do not call him.

503
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:27,740
That's one thing, it does.

504
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,640
You maybe not enough.

505
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:34,770
But I have nothing to do with your money.

506
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,030
Understand, I do not want it.

507
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,140
People who work their money are always.

508
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,930
I prefer the others because they have better motives.

509
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:55,370
However, we do not really want to go anywhere else.

510
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,580
They do not know where I work.

511
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:10,460
Within concrete blocks silent goes through automatically.

512
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:17,790
No one has replaced television for a long time.

513
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:33,800
It does not matter.

514
01:13:47,880 --> 01:14:05,530
We see the meaning of life.

515
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:13,280
You want to know technical details.

516
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:31,070
Why are you meeting me then?

517
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,990
There are no more technical difficulties.

518
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,350
It does not take more years.

519
01:14:47,070 --> 01:15:09,020
It is a proof to construct this bomb.

520
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,810
Do you know what I want now?

521
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:45,990
Do you understand atomic bombs?

522
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:17,210
I understand everything, but a few thousand people here in New York are busy with nothing else.

523
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,430
Including me if they accept that.

524
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:24,400
We can not use radio and press, because we are pure coincidence, depending on some stupid.

525
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,750
There is no hotel where I am our people.

526
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,170
May I help you! I have.

527
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,380
With 69?

528
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,700
We do not even have one.

529
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:13,880
Browse almost every room.

530
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:24,510
Have you run? You are not dressed.

531
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,500
Please do not make me angry.

532
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:38,010
Good, I'm here, but my divorce is already running.

533
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:41,310
We also want to marry what we want.

534
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:51,870
But Casanova could have gone awry too.

535
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:12,380
Shall not let me stop.

536
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,500
Is there a home search somewhere?

537
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,300
What happened then?

538
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,760
Please give me only water, it must not be.

539
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,240
But what happened?

540
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,140
Please do not ask, I can not answer you.

541
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:32,870
I have everything continuously day and night.

542
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:35,870
But maybe I already lost you.

543
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:47,230
Now, at that moment, because I can not say why I was where I was, I was looking for the police.

544
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:58,680
I do not get it. We have not known each other for a long time, but we do not know each other like a criminal.

545
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,330
It's not you.

546
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:04,050
You want to say, I do not need to explain you.

547
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:20,500
It's crazy. I have not had many goals in this life, I mean.

548
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,340
I had the goods wrong.

549
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,840
Now I see it. I have it all.

550
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,940
That's the best thing I've ever had.

551
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:35,210
John. And that includes everything happiness.

552
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,180
Suddenly everything gets.

553
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,910
I still have everything in my hand.

554
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,690
I can put an end to everything I've done so far.

555
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,330
You said it is fine in my opinion, if it is at my discretion.

556
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:01,160
So now I can finish with everything.

557
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:08,400
I stop. Would you go to South America with me?

558
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,020
Yes, I worked there.

559
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,160
I can start right now.

560
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,010
A life with you. If you want.

561
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:16,890
I am tomorrow, we lead everything in the way.

562
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,480
You can sell or rent the store.

563
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,600
I get the tickets.

564
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:26,890
Life is a nice thing.

565
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,330
After 30 hours we are in Rio.

566
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:51,530
Oh please, airport, I'll get a newspaper, I'll be right back.

567
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:09,990
You're under arrest. You are Gimpel.

568
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,690
I am glad that he caught you, you lasted longer than your predecessors.

569
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,160
They smoke, what drink.

570
01:26:50,460 --> 01:27:01,320
Take it as an expression of my appreciation for this achievement. After all, you have kept a few thousand people in suspense, not to mention panting.

571
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,340
But did you actually do this madness?

572
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:10,530
I know I could now make his hero out of me and say I do that for my country, what you do for your country.

573
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,610
But. I do not say it.

574
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:17,350
You caught me Enjoy your triumph?

575
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:09,470
Defendant Gimpel As chairman of this commission, I have the duty to inform you of the verdict that was passed on them.

576
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:16,830
You are found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death by hanging.

577
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,960
They should eat something when they starve.

578
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:03,710
I forget How long do I have to live?

579
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,960
Everyone always asks the same thing.

580
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:09,680
I do not know, but only twelve hours before.

581
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,520
That's the rule.

582
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:12,320
I'm here for three weeks now.

583
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:19,240
I know that the verdict in four weeks, after a week.

584
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:28,220
The cook will be annoyed if you send the food back.

585
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,260
He asked extra what you like.

586
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,630
Why wants to do a favor?

587
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:44,890
Tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow.

588
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:57,090
If you do not betray me. I have the suffering of 15 April in 4.

589
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:25,210
What is it, what?

590
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:31,490
What will you do? You should not build on this reputation.

591
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:33,050
There are other farms, they would not hear anything.

592
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:34,370
But I have nothing to say.

593
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:41,090
You do not hear me, that it has to happen someday.

594
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:42,770
That is nothing new.

595
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:46,590
But there is also something pretty.

596
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:55,660
You will be glad you have a visit when visiting a woman.

597
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,840
Come. You know it's forbidden.

598
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:07,530
I can not be annoying now.

599
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:40,370
Not allowed. Until I got the permission.

600
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,450
Good that you did not come too late.

601
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,790
I am very glad that I still see you.

602
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:52,370
Is there nothing left to do, is there no hope?

603
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,020
The petition for mercy is. They refused.

604
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,690
I dont say anything. Everything that I have to say, I have already told myself.

605
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:12,540
I am so sorry. We should not have met, because.

606
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:17,230
The luck to see or to suspect, that is too little.

607
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,410
The very thought of having it, almost having it.

608
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,360
This thought drives me crazy.

609
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,770
Eric. I'm still trying to do something.

610
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:32,680
Another pardon or something?

611
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:36,560
It's war. You have to hang me.

612
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:47,120
You just have to. If the war was over tomorrow they might pardon me, but it will not be a few weeks longer for me, a few weeks too long.

613
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,540
And that little bit is missing.

614
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:57,960
That's my death. Let's not talk about it!

615
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,320
I'm so glad you came.

616
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:02,180
The time is.

617
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:16,150
When the time comes, you have to go.

618
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:20,410
And thank you.

619
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:14,030
Tell me, have you been lucky in your life?

620
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:15,680
Yes, pretty much.

621
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,840
But in the end, I am here.

622
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:20,780
I stood.

623
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,450
What does that mean for me? Probably that you live.

624
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:35,300
Four, because no one is executed during this time.

625
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:43,720
Understand these are the weeks you are missing.

626
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:47,380
You will be pardoned for life.

627
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:51,750
That means again sometime you let them run.

628
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,700
Maybe in ten years.

629
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:03,640
Sometime.
